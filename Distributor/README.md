# MEWS Distributor

Distributor is a booking engine used for creating room reservations in the Mews Commander PMS from external sources. The provided options are either a redirect to a stand-alone Distributor website hosted directly with Mews, or a JavaScript widget which can be integrated to your website. We are also able to provide an API for the building your own reservation engine on top of the Mews Platform.

## Basic option (Stand-alone option)

If you're unsure of which one to use, go with the stand-alone option. It's the simplest way to connect your website with the booking engine. We will send you the link for where the hotel's booking engine is located - please contact our sales team for more information at sales@mewssystems.com

## Advanced options

If you are a developer, you might be interested in the more advanced ways of integrating with the Distributor into your website for a more seamless experience for guests. The Distributor widget is an embedable button (UI element) which enables booking directly from the hotel's own website. Please click the links below for the detailed documentation.
