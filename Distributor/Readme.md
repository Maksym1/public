# MEWS Distributor

Distributor is a booking engine used for creating room reservations in the Mews Commander PMS from external sources. The provided options are either a redirect to a stand-alone Distributor website hosted directly with Mews, or a JavaScript widget which can be integrated to your website. We are also able to provide an API for the building your own reservation engine on top of the Mews Platform.

## Standalone Page

If you're not sure which version to use, go with the standalone option. It's the simplest way how to connect your website with the booking engine. We will provide you with a link to the Distributor page where the booking engine is located. For further information, see [Distributor Standalone Page](./Standalone.md) or contact our sales team at sales@mewssystems.com

## Embedded Widget

If you are a developer, you might be interested in more advanced ways how to integrate the Distributor into your website. For more seamless experience, the Distributor javascript widget allows customers to book directly from website of your hotel without being redirected elsewhere. For more information, consult the [Distributor Embedded Widget](./Embedded.md).

## Custom Widget

In case you'd like to implement your own custom booking engine that would be connected with MEWS, you should have a look at [Distributor API](../Api/Distributor/). Please contact sales@mewssystems.com to activate this function.
